        <div class="small-text">Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. 
          Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground.
           Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter. t has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: 
           mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.Speak again the ancient oaths:
           Life before death.
           Strength before weakness.
           Journey before Destination.
           and return to men the Shards they once bore.
           The Knights Radiant must stand again.
